# Serial Forms

Forms don't have to be horrible.

Serial Forms aims to accomplish the following goals:

* Serialization is based on the naming convention for inputs.
* Must be easily extendable and work with any type of custom component (date
    pickers, bootstrap components, ect.). It should be a good foundation for
    other form frameworks and abstractions.
* Must make use of immutable data (via
    [immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)).
* Must be built with performance and compatibility in mind and well tested.
* Source code must be as good as any documentation.

# Installation

`npm install react-serial-forms`

# Usage

There are 3 main essential fundamental parts to Serial Forms:

1. Validation - On field change check value for validity.
2. Serialization - Extract data from form.
